[WIP] Web app that aims to support a player skill rating system for private lobbies in team based games such as Dota 2. 
Auto-balances a full lobby into balanced teams. 

Has some python dependencies, which can be installed with pip using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Start using gulp via the default gulp task ("gulp" in command line).

While it's still very limited in what you can do without other real users, there is a demo with a small amount of fake users already logged in, and no need to login via steam. It's far behind the master branch for now. https://infinite-mesa-54622.herokuapp.com
