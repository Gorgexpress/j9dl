[WIP] Web app that aims to support a player skill rating system for private lobbies in team based games such as Dota, Overwatch, etc...  
Auto-balances a full lobby into balanced teams. 

Has some python dependencies, which can be installed with pip using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Start with npm start. Requires the dev dependencies for now, and babel cli.
Can also start with "gulp" which will transpile the server side code

Refractoring code to use es6 and webpack in es6r branch.

There is a demo with a small amount of fake users already logged in, and no need to login via steam. It's behind the master branch for now, and still pretty limited in what you can do without other users. https://infinite-mesa-54622.herokuapp.com
